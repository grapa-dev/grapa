# grapa
grapa - a grammar parser language / environment for processing data for ETL workflows, or experimenting with new language constructs. 

## Introduction
The unique approach of grapa is that it includes native syntax for JSON/XML and BNF style grammars for defining data processing rules. The same grammar engine used to assist with parsing data is the same engine used to process the language. The syntax of the language can be customized (runtime-self-mutable) as the language rules are stored as global variables. If for example, you'd like to extend the langue to include some preferred syntax , that enhancement would function as native syntax. 

Underneath the syntax, there are several libraries that provide the lower level heavy lifting for strings, execution flow, files, networking, threads, classes with inheritance, encryption (RSA, AES, SHA, etc), math, database, etc. The grammar syntax you define can either invoke routines written in the existing syntax, or call lower level libraries. The native integer and float support uses unlimited precision (or limited by CPU/memory). 

Execution of all scripts (from code or compiled) run the same across all platforms, including the unlimited floating point routines. And will work the same on either big endian or little endian systems. 

## Setup
### Installation
Suported platforms include Win64, MacOS, Ubuntu64, Debian32, AWS.

To instally copy the zip for the target platform, unzip, and copy to the exectutable to an apprpriate directory. If needed, update the system PATH. The binaries are located in the "bin" directory in this GitHub repository.

There will be an installer for each of the platforms...but for now, drag and drop of the binary works.
Linux: Place in "/usr/bin" (or somewhere accessible). 
Windows: Place in a location that is in the PATH, or update PATH to the location the application is copied to.
Mac: Place in "/usr/local/bin" - first time running the tool will take about 20 seconds as the OS scans the executable. 

### Console
To exit while in the console, enter a '.' character.

Any grapa commands can be run interactively within the console.

If using paste to enter a block of code to run, ensure each line is not larger than the maximum line line for the console - break up the code into shorter lines.

If using paste to enter multiple lines that need to be run at the same time (such as when a single command spans multiple lines), enter `$[` sequence first and `$]` sequence at the end. This will trigger the lexical engine to signal to the grammar engine to pause grammar analysis until after all the tokens have been generated for the input stream. 

### Command line options

Once copied into a location (and PATH updated if needed), you'll be able to run the tool using "grapa" from a terminal or command shell from any location. Running the tool with "grapa --env" will display a few of the directories where the tool will look for information.

Other command line options:
```
        -h,--help       :Show this help message
        -v,--version    :Show version
        -q,--quite      :Suppress header
        -env            :Show environment details
        -ccmd script    :Run from script
        -cfile file     :Run from file
        -ccin           :Run from stdin
        -argcin         :Places std:cin into $ARGCIN environment variable (use with -ccmd|-cfile)
        -argv           :Places proceeding args into $ARGV environment variable
```

Example: Performs a SHAKE256 hash of the string "thisisatest".
```
grapa -ccmd "'thisisatest'.encode(SHAKE256)" -q
94B3D49AF1B6396CD186876793A5C4405A1BBFD12C7341521ABD62AA26E3E852B06B345D82126B1D864DFA885B6DC791D21A318259D307D76D7946D1EFF9DA54
```

Example: Same, but takes input from cin. 
```
echo "thisisatest".encode(SHAKE256) | grapa -ccin -q
94B3D49AF1B6396CD186876793A5C4405A1BBFD12C7341521ABD62AA26E3E852B06B345D82126B1D864DFA885B6DC791D21A318259D307D76D7946D1EFF9DA54
```

# Data Types

## Base Type

### $OP
This is the core type at the base of grapa. It does not have a class associated. Consider it as both a high level version of byte code (but represented as a list) and simular to a lambda in other languages. It's a variable that includes executable instructions. 

Understanding the inner workings of $OP is not necessary to use grapa - and this section can be skipped. This though is core to how grapa works, and an understanding is needed in order to extend the syntax of the language to support your own domain specific language extensions.

Examples:
Commands | Results | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
(op(){4*2})(); | 8 | Creates $OP and executes.
(@<mul,{4,2}>)(); | 8 | Same but using $OP directly.

Adding parameters to $OP.

Example: The op command is used for passing parameters into a function. When the op command is used, the name is replaced with an array where the first value is "op" and the second value is the function. This array is than followed by the parameter list. The parameters are used to initialize the namespace for the function.

Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
op(){1} | @<[op,1],{}>
op(a,b){@a*@b}; | @<[op,@<mul,{@<var,{a}>,@<var,{b}>}>],{a,b}>
op(){5%2}; | @<[op,@<mod,{5,2}>],{}>
op(){4*2}; | @<[op,8],{}>

In the last example above, the compiler implemented an optimization where it recognized that multiplying two constants could be completed at compile time.

See the section on syntax for additional examples.

### $CODE
A sequence of $OP items to be processed in sequence.  Normally you would use $CODE directly. It is typically embedded in an $OP type. The planner typically wraps the result in an $OP along with parameter handling for the function - but this could change at some point where it could be either $OP or $CODE. 

Example: Assigns 2 to a, than evaluates a*3, the result is 6
Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
f=@[1,2];</br>f(); | 2
f=op(){a=2;@a*3;};</br>@f; | @<[op,@[@<assign,{a,2}>,@<mul,{@<var,{a}>,3}>]],{}>
f(); | 6

## System Class Types

### $BOOL
The following are equivalent in comparisons:
- True: true, 1
- False: false, null

Examples:
Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
1==true; | true
null==false; | true
1==false; | false
"55"==(55).str(); | true
"5.54"==(5.54).str(); | true

### $STR
ASCII only - Unicode will eventually be added. Can initialize with either double quotes or single quotes - which is easier than escaping a string that includes a quoted string - such as "this 'is' a test", or 'this "is" a test'. $STR inherits the $obj class - see $obj for functions supported. 

Examples:
Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
"this is a test".len(); | 14
"this is a test".split(""); | ["t","h","i","s"," ","i","s"," ","a"," ","t","e","s","t"]
"this is a test".raw(); | 7468697320697320612074657374
"this is a test".raw().int(); | 2361031878030638688519054699098996

### $INT
Supports signed and unsigned. Unsigned is essentially an $INT that is not negative. Given this is unlimited precision, a separate $UINT type is not required (grapa originally had one, but it's been removed as it's essentially redundant and adds unnecessary complexity). The reason other languages have a $UINT type is to handle to bit overflow issue where the high order bit may become set during math operations. In grapa, when the high order bit is set, it automatically increases the precision and there is no overflow. Still, there is sometimes a need for specific $UINT type handling of raw bytes, and to support this there is a uint() function to ensure that a raw byte stream with a high order bit is not incorrectly interpreted as a negative number. 

The $INT class inherits $math class - see the the $math class for additional functions supported.

Examples:
Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
52322; | 52322
"52322".int(); | 52322
(52322).raw(); | 00CC62

Command | Example | Result
------------ | ------------- | -------------
(n).modinv(m) | (3504).modinv(385) | 79
(n).modpow(p,m) | (4).modpow(13,497) | 445
(bits).random() | (16).random() | 11942
(bits).genprime() | (16).genprime() | 60913</br>
(prime).isprime() | (60913).isprime() | 1
(bits).genrsa() | (2048).genrsa() | {"n":15393516245753936682160067234556253412750430802255743778814229572544054294097259619627956984788210632327430260756422996446381253153249781345283196778146943869627387098734177324722359738660665976616853578383297592405166139097576403800731299888096509467468294806244038979679705825508378722753372351633863988005907566854534544949211856629499511658312380872778697665853199690604789204003585821802286627943688070991768307690016267599491818375209115984992719308845944592197596445761556160073580204570454244818609933341847015039592523178376768260760784860436523239377646201172460077663895533645989009628971123289151850803431,"e":65537,"d":13641994957861797801239860002487559671827288722325001124151707486967036535104884854479023172810767559173858271582969126350089616295233948769916963987896524100095497851511070372764616226275409004408301506515432872528374038463573821394730822245458981489396196993250435386725015095984354429063214156627474867988597189451628997325925681141616557506588552488558841864362946322635349455724856402259625223168594174978986354594425814335237529438542251361036952837522411419140167302914778094265903749135384053575403257513464743052615490964725367349355084629511192897896262038309134665089785944182678712425681786027820252233473,"p":127525351491210739758506603062091339866602472144588924864153885241513959931528868361901295124271172489233580871065840798194041581977748077769443836206183903474877250523613161796934787318751453058205160524179069496822619466659130977085289078629456414992621730953731935128046011636107260954453798334287510785301,"q":120709459458458215149090987557869193974463585849659373482943650636124808813105265511854715553573984494307648288391119051840787006493359514518751056098674649187782133751617034710796002529153468083214633567324645517989231684251962352981897617821614879663479614766494007790854662782949676080820575455806904229131,"dp":108596095966751303464951020191529297749595150341293670869029161869534043209464800256486402789118358567704303139193333675731438220373165425213770710512091146513105947395705127587853175236464895306855239081647156408565750184091115563729693122804390391142762503361411501404719774530410457094574240982014002615573,"dq":79822185239035386547008639681140960502697756741268869920866257705851304825401772994686355229271851626017438416807212986079253357453182395291417569757608098425318554595535026783290006524687626833549838862638135518235764876819377518860025313352047631946165975628275894679952688949562431328724264142450213093093,"qi":85353290251593823983293134708457294766739743735581970939586643632920134544715934389683783433537242132792046190122480630405078881427501723330138575663576456847405896072681721913683535190255437598808737817039439311188397481130265056015078027907590498609730777468666008326788985545089258489739084708975591421831}

The genprime and genrsa commands are not threaded at this time. Once threaded, performance will increase.

### $FLOAT

Supports both fix and float format. Fix will apply the precision to just the decimal. Float will not restrict to the decimal, supporting large exponents with a specified precision. Each number maintains it's own precision, which is used in math operations with numbers of other precision. Some math operations may convert an input from one format to another. For example, passing in a float to a trig function will produce a fix format result. Floats also support specifying "extra" bits to apply to the calculations to reduce error propagation (the default is 7 bits). 

The $FLOAT class inherits $INT class - see the the $INT class for additional functions supported.

Example:
```
> 5.13
5.13
```

You can also create using hex format:
```
> -0x4.0x5
-4.3125
```

Or binaary format:
```
> 0b101.11
5.625
```

By default, all floats are "float" format. To change formats use the fix() and float() routines, where both the precision and the "extra" bits can also be specified. The parsing engine will set the precision to the system default, which is 128 bits. There are two ways to change this. First, change the system default using the setfloat and setfix routines. Second, pass in a $STR to the fix or float routines. For example:

```
> "3.5".float(300,6)
3.5
```

To verify the float is being created properly, use the decode routine with FLOAT as the parameter. For example:

```
> "30.75".float(300,6).decode(FLOAT)
{"sign":false,"trunc":false,"fix":false,"exp":4,"max":300,"extra":6,"data":123}
> (30.75).decode(FLOAT).data
123

> (30.75).decode(FLOAT).data.hex()
7B
```

Convert to other formats:
```
> (30.75).hex()
1E.C

> (30.75).bin()
11110.0011

> (30.75).int()
30

> (30.75).raw()
00048100077B
```

Bit shifts:
```
> (30.75) >> 4
1.921875

> (30.75) << 4
492
```

### $ID
Any identifier (starts with a letter and can follow with numbers and '-' but can not end with '-') will be initialized as an $ID. And an $ID can be used for many things, including associating a value. The '@' symbol is used to de-reference an $ID to retrieve the data stored.

Example of using an $ID as a variable:
```
> x = "hi"

> @x
hi

> @x + " test"
hi test
```

### $LIST
A $LIST is basically JSON, but extended to include all the various grapa data types. 

Action | Example | Result
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Create | {a:1, b:2, c:3} | {a:1, b:2}
Access | {a:1, b:2, c:3}.a</br>{a:1, b:2, c:3}[1]</br>{a:1, b:2, c:3}[-1] | 1</br>1</br>3
Append | x = {a:1, b:2};</br>x += (c:3);</br>@x; | </br></br>{a:1, b:2, c:3}
Append | x = {a:1, b:2};</br>x ++= {c:3,d:4};</br>@x; | </br></br>{a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
Insert | x = {a:1, b:2};</br>x += (c:3) @x[0];</br>@x; | </br></br>{"c":3,"a":1,"b":2}
Count | {a:1, b:2, c:3}.len() | 3
Remove | x = {a:1, b:2, c:3};</br>x -= @x[1];</br>@x; | </br></br>{a:1, c:3}

### $ARRAY
Same as $LIST, but without the entry labels.

Supports an offset search if the contents of the array are $ID or $STR or $ARRAY values.
```
> months = [JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEP,OCT,NOV,DEC];
> @months[MAR];
2
> @months[FFF];
ERR: {"err":-1}
```

If the elements are $ARRAY type, the first item of the array is used for the match.
```
> x = [[a,496],[b,964],[c,221]];
> @x.b;
1
> @x[@x.b];
[b,964]
> @x.g
ERR: {"err":-1}
```

There isn't currently built in support for searching for an $ARRAY or $LIST item within an $ARRAY. Currently, this would require an itterator to scan and compare, or the use of a hash of the contents as a key.

### $TIME
Uses UTC timezone. $TIME is intended to be a timestamp starting at Jan 1 1970, and a timer for tracking the passage of time. 

Examples:
```
> (0).time();
1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000

> $TIME().tz();
-25200000000000

> $TIME().tz()/1000000000
-25200

> $TIME().utc();
2020-07-10T19:05:58.6135794

> $TIME().utc() + $TIME().tz();
2020-07-10T12:06:15.9529207

> t1 = $TIME().utc();

> @t1.delta();
3.8281652

/* From an AWS docker container on Win10 */
> a = $TIME().utc(); (($TIME().utc()-@a)/1000000000.0).str()+" seconds";
0.000012 seconds
```

The following illustrate using various date ranges.
'''
> "1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638".time();
1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638

> "1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638".time() + 24*60*60*1000000000;
1020-04-24T12:33:33.921638

> "-1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638".time() + 1;
-1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638001

> "-1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638".time().int();
-94345471586078362000

> (-94345471586078362000).time();
-1020-04-23T12:33:33.921638
''''

And a side effect of using 1970 as the center. 
```
> a = $TIME().utc();

> @a;
2020-07-10T19:51:26.3316532

> (0-@a).time();
1919-06-24T04:08:33.6683468
```

### $TABLE
A $TABLE is a hierarchical database with columns, rows, with both row store and columns store. 

See $file commands for creating, updated, and navigating.
```
> f=$file().table()
> @f.ls()
[]

> @f.set("test","value")
> @f.ls()
[{"$KEY":"test","$TYPE":"ROW","$BYTES":5}]

> @f.get("test")
value

> @f.type()
$TABLE
```

### $RAW
A $RAW represents raw bytes. Most data types can be converted to and from $RAW, providing the ability to make specific tweaks to data. For example, this is how time addition/subtraction is performed - by converting the $TIME into $RAW and then into an $INT, and than back to a $TIME. There are several examples of using raw in the documentation for the other data types.

When displayed, the value is printed in hex form, but the value in memory is in raw. If you convert to hex(), the result will be a text version of the hex of the raw data.

```
> "hi".raw();
6869

> "hi".raw().int();
26729

> (0x6869).raw().str();
hi
```

### $XML
$XML is an array of $TAG values. The $XML class also inherits the $ARRAY class, and any operation that works on an $ARRAY will work on an $XML. 

For consistency, entering a single $TAG will always result in the creation of $XML, where the $XML includes at least 1 $TAG. 

To reference items in $XML, use an index.
```
> x = <test one=1>data</test><tt hi=dd />;
> @x[0];
<test one=1>data</test>
```

Or specify a tag value.
```
> x = <test one=1>data</test><tt hi=dd />;
> @x.tt;
<tt hi=dd />
```

### $TAG

At $TAG is a named $EL (element). See $EL. A $TAG is a $LIST with a single $EL item. 

Use "getname()" to get the name of the $TAG.
```
> x = <test one=1 two=2>data</test>;
> @x[0].getname();
test
```

### $EL
Short for element. An $EL is the value of the $TAG without the name. There is always 1 single $EL in a $TAG. The value of an $EL is typically 2 items, an "attr" list and an "xml" array. The "attr" is a $LIST, and the "xml" is an $XML. 

```
> x = <test one=1 two=2>data</test>;
> @x[0].attr.two;
2

> x = <test one=1 two=2>data</test>;
> @x[0].xml[0];
data
```

### $RULE
This datatype is basis of the grapa language. The syntax of the language is implemented as a set of global rule variables that are accessible and changeable - making the grapa language syntax dynamically mutable, either globally, or modified within a specific function by creating local variable rules that override the global rules. Rules variables can also be defined to support parsing of a domain specific language, or defining a data ETL task as a language by defining the rules for the data and applying the data to the rules - in the same way a language would be defined.

There are three basic steps:
* Define the rules (rules may reference other rules) with code to execute for each rule option.
* Apply raw data to the rule to generate an execution plan.
* Execute the plan, with parameters if specified.

Example system rule:
```
> @$start
rule <$command_list> $SYSID("BE") | <$command_list> ';' | <$command_list>
```

The above is the entry point to the grapa language. This entry point is a global variable that can be updated...so take caution as it is the default entry point all scripts. It is also possible to navigate the language syntax by looking up each rule that is lined from any other rule.

Example of defining a custom rule, and applying the rule:
```
> x = rule $INT $INT {op(a:$1,b:$2){@a*@b}} | $INT {op(a:$1){@a}}
> (op()("4",@x))()
4

> (op()("4 3",@x))()
12

> op()("4",@x)
@<[op,@<[op,@<var,{a}>],{"a":4}>]>

> op()("4 3",@x)
@<[op,@<[op,@<mul,{@<var,{a}>,@<var,{b}>}>],{"a":4,"b":3}>]>
```

To simplify creating rules that depend on matching on a predefined list of values, create a list and reference the list in the rules. If the rule matches, the value of the matched item is passed in as the token value.

```
> t = {x:"matched on x",y:5};
> r = rule $INT @t $INT {op(a:$2){@a}};
> (op()("1 x 2",@r))();
matched on x

> (op()("1 y 2",@r))();
5
```

If the lookup needs to be against something other than a list (maybe checking a database or even a web service), an operation can be added to a rule token that will run at compile time if the rule matches. Note that this will be called during the planning phase (or compile time) every time the rule is evaluated - so take caution on attaching a heavy workload. The result of the operation will be used as the result of the token matched. 

```
> x = rule $STR {@<lit,{$1}>};
> r = rule $INT <x,op(a:$1){@a.len()}> $INT {op(a:$2){@a}};
> (op()("44 'x' 22",@r))();
1
```

Rules can also be embedded. Unfortunately, the current grammar requires an operation for a rule if the rule is to return any value - it doesn't make any assumptions. So as of the current release an embedded rule of (x|y) would match on x or y, but with no operation attached to x or y the result would not produce an output for the match. In some future version, this will be addressed to return a default. For now, an operation needs to be inserted if you want a value to be returned.

If the token handler returns an $ERR object, it will cause the rule to fail. So it not only has the ability to add additional logic to processing the token, is also can also serve as an additional component to the planning engine by validating the token against the intent of the rule - something that could not be done at a later phase and could only be done during the planning/compile phase. 

```
> r = rule $INT (x{@<lit,{"found x"}>}|y{@<lit,{"found y"}>}) $INT {op(a:$2){@a}};
> (op()("44 y 22",@r))();
found y
```

If there is a well known end sequence, and you want to collect all the tokens in between, you can insert an empty rule. All of the tokens, including any white space, will be passed on. The risk of using this in a rule is that if the end token does not exist, all tokens will be processed in the empty rule. 

```
> r = rule $INT <> $INT {op(a:$2){@a}};
> (op()("44 'x' 22",@r))();
[" ","x"," "]
```

The stop rule for a catchall can be either a token, a rule reference, or an embedded rule.

```
> e = rule $INT {@<lit,{$1}>} | $ID {@<lit,{$1}>};
> r = rule $INT <> <e> {op(a:$3){@a}};
> (op()("44 'x' 22",@r))();
22

> (op()("44 'x' hi",@r))();
hi

> r = rule $INT <> ($INT{@<lit,{$1}>}|$ID{@<lit,{$1}>}) {op(a:$3){@a}};
> (op()("44 'x' 22",@r))();
22

> (op()("44 'x' hi",@r))();
hi
```

A operation can also be associated with the empty rule above, which can process the tokens and either pass through the list, or pass through some transformed version. The following is an example f transforming.

```
> r = rule $INT <op(a:$1){@a.len().str()+" raw characters:"+@a.join("")}> $INT {op(a:$2){@a}};
> (op()("44 'x' 22",@r))();
3 raw characters: x
```

If the token handler returns an $ERR object, the corresponding rule option will fail and the next rule option will be evaluated. The following is an example of causing the first rule option to fail.

```
> r = rule $INT <op(a:$1){$ERR()}> $INT {op(a:$2){@a}} | $INT <> $INT {op(a:$2){@a}};
> (op()("44 'x' 22",@r))();
[" ","x"," "]
```

The catchall token can also be used to add support for comments in a grammar. The following is used in the grapa syntax. This rule is then inserted in places in the grammar where comments can be included. 

```
$starcomment = rule ('/' '*') <> ('*' '/');
```

Rules can include both right recursion and left recursion.  The following is an example of right recursion. Note that an internal function "prepend" is used to build the list. This is because grapa uses recursive decent, which results in the last match being processed first.

```
> r1 = rule $ID <r1> {@<prepend,{$2,$1}>} | $ID {@<createarray,{$1}>};
> (op()("a b c",@r1))();
[a,b,c]
```

But right recursion may not be desirable in some cases. One example is order of operations for additon and subtraction, where the evaluation needs to happen from left to right. Here is an example using right recursion. 

```
r1 = rule 
     $INT '+' <r1>             {@<add,{$1,$3}>} 
  | $INT '-' <r1>              {@<sub,{$1,$3}>} 
  | $INT                            {@<lit,{$1}>}
  ;

> op()("5-3+2",@r1);
@<[op,@<sub,{5,@<add,{3,2}>}>],{}>

> (op()("5-3+2",@r1))();
0
```

Note that for "5-3+2", the additon of 3+2 happens first resulting in 5-(3+2), which produces the wrong answer. 

Left recursion is required to address this.

```
r2 = rule 
     <r2> '+' $INT       {@<add,{$1,$3}>} 
  | <r2> '-' $INT        {@<sub,{$1,$3}>} 
  | $INT                      {@<lit,{$1}>}
  ;

> op()("5-3+2",@r2);
@<[op,@<add,{@<sub,{5,3}>,2}>],{}>

> (op()("5-3+2",@r2))();
4
```

Note that with left recursion, the subtraction happens first resulting in (5-3)+2, which produces the correct answer.

For those interested in how to modify a recursive decent parser to support left recursion, see the following on how this was addressed for Python:
	○ https://medium.com/@gvanrossum_83706/left-recursive-peg-grammars-65dab3c580e1
A simular approach is used for Grapa - but with a few improvements on the appropach to support more complex scenarios than what's required to support the Python syntax alone.


### $ERR
If an operation results in an error, the $ERR data type is returned. Check using the type function: if (@result.type()==$ERR) something;

Under the hood, the $ERR type is a $LIST, and the same commands can be used to get more details on the error.

```
> (1/0).type()==$ERR
1
```

## System Class Types

### $SYSID
Same as $ID, but was initialized with '$' at the front of the identifier. Used for special system identifiers. 

### $SYSINT
Same as $INT, but was initialized with '$' at the front of the integer. Used for special system integers. 

### $SYSSTR
Same as $STR, but was initialized with '$' at the front of the string. Used for special system strings. 

## Defined Class Types

### $sys
A few general utility functions that are useful, but it wasn't clear if they should be added to the native language syntax, were added to $sys.

#### type (object)
```
> $sys().type(5)
$INT
```

#### getenv (type)

getenv/putenv types:
Type | Description
------------ | -------------
$PATH | 
$STATICLIB |
$ARGCIN |
$ARGV |
$LIB |
$BIN |
$NAME |
$WORK |
$HOME |
$TEMP |
$VERSION |
$LICENCE |
$PLATFORM | C++/G++ compile flags
Any value not starting with '$' will be directed to the native OS getenv/putenv |

```
> $sys().getenv($VERSION)
{"major":0,"minor":0,"micro":2,"releaselevel":"alpha","serial":63,"date":2020-04-24T16:30:37.000000}
```

Values for $PLATFORM 
* `__APPLE__`
* `_WIN32`
* `_WIN64`
* `__linux__`
* `__ANDROID__`
* `_MSC_VER`
* `_MSC_FULL_VER`
* `__GNUC__`
* `__GNUC_MINOR__`
* `__clang__`
* `__MINGW32__`
* `__MINGW64__`
* `__i386__`
* `__x86_64__`
* `__arm__`
* `__ARM_ARCH_5T__`
* `__ARM_ARCH_7A__`
* `__powerpc64__`
* `__aarch64__`

#### putenv (type, value)
See getenv.

### $obj
Several classes inherit $obj, such as $STR and $INT and $LIST. Functions that can be used across the different data types are placed in the $obj class. Some of these functions may move to other classes. The $obj class is a general place to place functions as a starting point. For example, the setfloat and setfix functions may move to the $sys class. 

There is not much use in creating an $obj instance on it's own. 

#### type()
All objects will return the type.

"test".type() will return $STR, for example.

If the item does not support type(), use $sys().type(value). For example, $sys().type("test") returns $STR.


#### describe (object)
This is stubbed out...but not yet implemented. Type will provide just the type. Describe will provide more detail. If using describe on a table, details about the table will be returned, for example. Intention is to provide describe everywhere that type is available.

#### raw()
Converts a value into it's raw bytes. Displays in hex form, but is stored in raw. Required in many cases as an intermediate form. For example, converting from a $STR to an $INT, you have two choices.

```
> "34".int();
34

> "34".raw();
3334

> "34".raw().int();
13108
```

#### uraw()
Converts to an unsigned raw value. To avoid sign issues, a leading zero is added to raw/int. To remove, used uraw and uint.

```
> (0xFF).raw();
00FF

> (0xFF).uraw();
FF

> (0xFF).raw().int();
255

> (0xFF).raw().uint();
255

> (0xFF).uraw().int();
-1

> (0xFF).uraw().uint();
255
``

#### bool()
Converts to what the system sees as true/false.

```
> "1".bool();
true

> (0).bool();
false

#### int()
Converts to $INT.

"44".int() -> 44

#### uint()
Converts to unsigned $INT.

See $INT.

#### float([bits [,extra]])
Converts to $FLOAT. Sets bit count for the entire number. Calculations are performed with "extra" bits and truncated for display.

"4.21".float() -> 4.21

"4.21".float(300,7) / "10412.42".float(300,7) -> 0.00040432483514879346011782083319727786624050893068085997299379010835137268761728

("4.21".float(300,7) / "10412.42".float(300,7)).float(50) -> 0.00040432483514879

#### fix([bits [,extra]])
Converts to fixed float. Sets bit count after the decimal to bits. Calculations are performed with "extra" bits and truncated for display.

#### setfloat([bits [,extra]])
Sets the default float type to float, and the default bits and extra.

#### setfix([bits [,extra]])
Sets the default float type to fix, and the default bits and extra.

#### str()
Converts to string. 

(44).str() -> "44"

#### base(base)
Converts number to base. Base of power of 2 works well. Have not fully tested others. Performed as a series of mods and divisions. So can become expensive on very large numbers. Split large numbers into parts before using - but careful on the split.

"bbbtestingbbb".trim(b) -> "testing"

#### lpad(n,[str])
Pads left to bring the total size up to n characters. Defaults to pad with a space, but will use str for padding if provided. 

Will left truncate input if length of input is less than n.

"test".lpad(7,"X") -> "XXXtest"

#### rpad(n,[str])
Pads left to bring the total size up to n characters. Defaults to pad with a space, but will use str for padding if provided.

#### decode (type, value [,options])
See encode.

#### setfile($file, name)
Updates file or table item with value. Separate from the $file class as this one supports chaining all the way to writing the result into a file. Requires having an existing $file instance -> or passing in $file() which creates a temporary instance.

"testing".setfile($file(),"test.txt");

#### map($OP [,params])
See map in the Looping section. Iterates through a $LIST/$ARRAY calling an $OP. Processes each item in parallel, so be sure $OP is thread safe. If not, use reduce instead of map. Result of $OP placed in a $LIST/$ARRAY which is returned at the completion.

#### filter($OP [,params])
See filter in the Looping section. Iterates through a $LIST/$ARRAY calling an $OP. Processes each item in parallel, so be sure $OP is thread safe. If not, use filter instead of map. If $OP of op is true, item is placed in a $LIST/$ARRAY which is returned at the completion. 

#### reduce($OP [,start [,params]])
See reduce in the Looping section. Iterates through a $LIST/$ARRAY calling an $OP. Processes each item in sequence as the intent is to combine results of each $OP. If "start" not provided, the first item of the list is used as the start. 

#### sort([op])
Sorts a $LIST.

{z:1,m:2,p:3,b:4}.sort() -> {"b":4,"m":2,"p":3,"z":1}

Optionally pass in a compare routine.'''
'''
> [b,a,B,c,b,A].sort()
[A,B,a,b,b,c]

> [b,a,B,c,b,A].sort(op(a,b){@a.upper()<=>@b.upper();})
[a,A,B,b,b,c]

> [b,a,B,c,b,A].sort(op(a,b){@local.c=@a.upper()<=>@b.upper();if(@c==0)c=@a<=>@b;@c;})
[A,a,B,b,b,c]
'''

#### unique([op])
Remove duplicates names.

{z:1,b:4,m:2,p:3,m:2,b:4}.unique() -> {"z":1,"b":4,"m":2,"p":3}

Optionally pass in a compare routine.'''

> [b,a,B,c,b,A].unique(op(a,b){@a.upper()<=>@b.upper();})
[b,a,c]
'''

#### isint
Checks if a string is an $INT.

"z55".isint() -> false
"55".isint() -> true

#### iferr(new)
If value is $ERR type, the new is used. Otherwise the value is used.

(10/2).iferr(55) -> 5
(10/0).iferr(55) -> 55

#### exec()
Executes string in the shell of the operating system. 

```
> "ver".exec()
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.778]
```

#### getname([index])
Used in a map/reduce/filter to identify the name of the passed in item from the original list (if processing a $LIST). 

To use, do not de-reference the identify. The getname function will then see that it is an $ID and will attempt to locate it in the namespace. Since what is passed in is a pointer, the function is able to discover the item in the original list and discover the name.

```
> {a:1,b:2}.map(op(a){a.getname()})
{"a":a,"b":b}
```

Or used to get the name of an item in a $LIST, using the index parameter.

```
> {a:1,b:2}.getname(0)
a
```

#### echo()
Outputs item to stdio.

#### string()
Outputs escaped version of item to stdio

### $file()
Provides the ability to navigate either the file system or a database, querying data and updating data. This class/libraries will be enhanced over time to support navigating data types beyond the file system and the grapa database - such as JSON/XML and unstructured data where a mapping can be defined (maybe with a set of rules). With a few additional enhancements, this class/library will also enable extending the grapa syntax to include SQL with $file for the underlying data.

Each example below assumes the following command has been issued:
<pre><code> f = $file();</code></pre>
Which assignes f an instance of the $file class. The following are then operations that can be used from the $file class.

The name field for the commands can include a path relative to the "working directory" (see pwd()). If the "working directory" is a OS filesystem directory, than the path must reference a file within the OS filesystem. If the "working directory" is a grapa table, than the path and data item would be within the grapa table. What is not currently supported is referencing a grapa table item when the "working directory" is not within a grapa table.

#### type()
```
> @f.type()
$file
```
#### table()
The table function creates an in memory database. 

```
> t = @f.table()
> @t.mkrow("test","data for test")
> @t.getrow("test")
data for test
```
#### pwd()
Returns the current working directory, relative to the current home directory. 
```
> @f.pwd()
/

> @f.cd("lib")
> @f.pwd()
/lib
```
#### cd([name])
Changes the current working directory, relative to the current home directory.  Using ".." will result in moving back 1 level.
```
> @f.cd("lib")
> @f.pwd()
/lib
```
#### phd()
Returns the current home directory.
```
> @f.phd()
C:\Projects\Test
```
#### chd(filesystempath)
Changes the current home directory.
```
> @f.chd("lib")
> @f.phd()
C:\Projects\Test\lib
```
#### ls([name])
Retrieves a list of files/directories in the current working directory.

```
> @f.chd("/Microsoft/AndroidNDK64/android-ndk-r16b/python-packages");
> @f.ls();
[
  {"$KEY":"adb","$TYPE":"DIR","$BYTES":0},
  {"$KEY":"Android.bp","$TYPE":"FILE","$BYTES":784},
  {"$KEY":"fastboot","$TYPE":"DIR","$BYTES":0},
  {"$KEY":"gdbrunner","$TYPE":"DIR","$BYTES":0},
  {"$KEY":"NOTICE","$TYPE":"FILE","$BYTES":577},
  {"$KEY":"repo.prop","$TYPE":"FILE","$BYTES":4465}
]

> @f.chd("/Microsoft/AndroidNDK64/android-ndk-r16b");
> @f.ls("python-packages");
[
  {"$KEY":"adb","$TYPE":"DIR","$BYTES":0},
  {"$KEY":"Android.bp","$TYPE":"FILE","$BYTES":784},
  {"$KEY":"fastboot","$TYPE":"DIR","$BYTES":0},
  {"$KEY":"gdbrunner","$TYPE":"DIR","$BYTES":0},
  {"$KEY":"NOTICE","$TYPE":"FILE","$BYTES":577},
  {"$KEY":"repo.prop","$TYPE":"FILE","$BYTES":4465}
]
```

#### mk(name [,type]) 
Creates a directory at the current working directory within the file system.

type is one of:
- "", if in the file system will default to "DIR"
- "DIR", if in the file system, a new directory will be created. If in the database, will use "GROUP"
- "GROUP", create a database of GROUP type
- "ROW", create a ROW store database
- "COL", create a COL store database

```
> @f.mk("test")
> @f.cd("test")
> @f.ls()
[]

> @f.mk("testg","GROUP")
> @f.cd("testg")
> @f.ls()
[]
```

#### rm(name)
Removes a directory or file.
```
> @f.rm("test")
```

#### set(name, value [, field])
Updates the column in a row. By default the $VALUE column is updated. But an alternate column can be specified.

field defaults to $VALUE.

```
> @f.set("test","value of test")
```

#### get(name [, field])
Gets the column value in a row. By default the $VALUE column is retrieved. But an alternate column can be specified.

field defaults to $VALUE.

```
> @f.set("test","value of test")
> @f.get("test")
value of test
```

#### mkfield(name [,fieldType[, storeType[, storeSize[, storeGrow]]]])
Creates a field within the current working directory.

```
> @f.mkfield("test")
```

Default for all fields is fieldType=STR and storeType=VAR. 

fieldType | Description
------------ | -------------
BOOL | Fixed size for $BOOL
TIME | Stores an $INT. Size depeds on storeType and storeSize
INT | Stores an $INT. Size depeds on storeType and storeSize
FLOAT | Stores a $FLOAT. Size depends on storeType and storeSize
STR | Stores a $STR. Size depends on storeType and storeSize
TABLE | Stores a $TABE. Size depends on storeType and storeSize
RAW | Stores a $RAW. Size depends on storeType and storeSize

storeType | Description
------------ | -------------
FIX | Fixed field size, set storeSize and storeGrow. Data embedded in row/col.
VAR | Variable field size. Uses an extra reference for the data. Reference stored in row/col.
PAR | Partitioned field. Best for very large data requiring updates to portions of the data. Also used for COL store $TABLE types.

storeGrow is used by variable fields to determine how much to grow the field by when extra space is needed.

#### rmfield(name)
Deletes a field within the current working directory.

#### debug()
Used for debugging the database during development. Displays the BTree structure of the data dictionary and fields and indexes for the current working directory when in a database (either in memory or on the file system).

### $net
Provides a socket library, cross functional with all platforms supported. 

Take caution on accessing shared resources from within a map or reduce or $thread or $net operation...ensure thread safe by using lock/unlock (any variable can be used for lock/unlock).

#### type()
Returns $net.

#### mac()
```
> $net().mac()
{"name":"Ethernet","ip":"xx.0.77.49","mac":FB75B4FEFE09BBC8}
```

#### interfaces()

```
> $net().interfaces()
{
  {"name":"Ethernet","mac":"FB75B4FEFE09BBC8","family":"IPV6","address":"xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx::xxx"},      
  {"name":"Ethernet","mac":"FB75B4FEFE09BBC8","family":"IPV6","address":"xxx:xxx:xxxx:xxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxx"}
  {"name":"Ethernet","mac":"FB75B4FEFE09BBC8","family":"IPV4","address":"xx.0.77.49"},
}
```

#### connect(url)

```
n2 = $net();
@n2.connect('localhost:12345');
```
#### bind(url)
Using bind/listen requires setting up at least 2 net objects. One for bind and the other for listen. See listen().
```
n1 = $net();
@n1.bind(':12345');
```

#### listen(net)
Pass in a bound net object. Listen is blocking, so a $thread may be needed to manage - or separate threads if more than one listener.

For those familiar with using sockets in C++, the $net class is a representation of sockets, and use bind/listen in the same way.

```
n1 = $net();
@n1.bind(':12345');
n2 = $net();
@n2.listen('@n1);
```

#### onlisten(url,messageHandler [,connectHandler [,count:1]])

Accomplishes the same as bind/listen, but handled in a background thread and much easier to setup.

When a connection is initiated, a new thread and new network object is created, and that new network object binds to the connect. The connectHandler is then called to provide a way to initialize data structures, and than the messageHandler is called for incoming data. The connectHandler receives 1 parameter - an updateable variable. The messageHandler recieves 2 parameters - the message and a hasmore flag. If the hasmore is 0, the data can be processed. If the message length is zero, the remote connection terminated and messageHandler should cleanup as the thread will be closing. 

The count defines the number of listeners - but fixed to 1 for now. Once a connection is established, the listener automatically restarts. For reasonable workloads, the 1 should be sufficient. For now if more is needed, use Bind/Listen - this though with require the use of $thread. 

The following sets up a simple web service. Use postman to post messages to verify.

```
processPost = op(in)
{
	{processed:@in};
}

postHandler = op(in) 
{
	@local.data = @in.split("\r").join("");
	@local.len = @data.len() - @data.split("\n\n")[0].len() - 2;
	if (@len<0) len=0;
	@local.body = @data.right(@len);
	@local.rstr = @processPost(@body).str();
	"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/json\r\nContent-Length: "+@rstr.len().str()+"\r\n\r\n"+@rstr;
};

postConnectHandler = op(netSession)
{
	@netSession.data = "";
};

postMessageHandler = op(netSession,message,hasmore)
{
	@netSession.data += @message;
	if (@hasmore==0)
	{
		@netSession.send(@postHandler(@netSession.data));
		@netSession.data = "";
	};
};

n=$net();
@n.onlisten(':12345',@postMessageHandler,@postConnectHandler);
```

To very, try the following.
```
n2 = $net();
err = @n2.connect('localhost:12345');
err = @n2.send('POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\n\r\n{try:55}');
@n2.nreceive();
@n2.receive();
@n2.disconnect();
```

#### disconnect()
Disconnects the session. Disconnecting a listener will disconnect all sessions the listener is a parent of.

#### certificate([file])
Sets $net instance to SSL mode with certificate file.

Use certificate() to revert back to non-SSL.

See SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file.

#### private(file [,passOp [,param]])
Server in SSL mode requires a private key file. 

If the private key file is password protected, also provide an $OP for the SSL routines to request the password. If a param is added, the callback will include the param. 

See SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file.

#### trusted(file, path)

See SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.

#### verify()

Call after connecting with SSL.

Returns a list:
	result
	certificate

See the following for result codes:
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/verify.html

Use decode(PEM) to decode the certificate.
```
> x = @n2.verify();
> @x.certificate.decode(PEM);
```

#### chain()

Certificate chain.

Use decode(PEM) to decode.
```
> x = @n2.chain();
> @x[0].decode(PEM);
```

#### host()

After running the sample in onlisten, try the following.
```
@n.host();
{"url":":12345","host":"computer name","ip":"XX.XX.XX.XX","port":12345,"family":2,"connected":0,"bound":1}
```

#### send(message)
See example in onlisten.

NOTE: If using SSL and the remote system breaks the connection, first send will return no error. The second send will return an error. This is not the case for read - where the first read after a broken connection will return an error and close the connection.

#### receive()
Blocks until data is received. Use nreceive() first to verify data exists. Or use onreceive.

See example in onlisten.

#### pending()
Number of bytes that can be received.

If an SSL connection, the byte count will be what is pending in the SSL encrypted buffer, which is different than the unencrypted data. 

See example in onlisten.

#### onreceive(handler)
Handler will be called when data is received.

```
receiveHandler = op(netSession,message,hasmore)
{
	@netSession.data += @message;
	if (@hasmore==0)
	{
		(@netSession.data+"\n").echo();
		(@<prompt>)();
		@netSession.data = "";
	};
};

n2 = $net();
@n2.connect('localhost:12345');
@n2.onreceive(@receiveHandler);
@n2.send('POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\n\r\n{try:55}');
@n2.send('POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\n\r\n{try:400}');
@n2.disconnect();
```

### $thread
Provides a thread library, cross functional with all platforms supported.

Take caution on accessing shared resources from within a map or reduce or $thread or $net operation...ensure thread safe by using lock/unlock (any variable can be used for lock/unlock).

#### type()
$thread

#### trylock()
Attempts to lock.

#### lock()
Applies a lock.

#### unlock()
Releases the lock.

#### wait()
Current thread waits for signal.

#### signal()
Signals the wait to continue.

#### waiting()
Indicates in waiting state.

#### start(runOp, input, doneOp)
Starts the runOp in the background, passing paramList. When the thread exists, doneOp is called. All 3 inputs are copied,  as the originals are likely to go away after running the start command. So if an instance of object is passed in, the thread will end up using a copied instance and not the original instance.

The thread is run from the same namespace as where it is called. To use a shared object instance, access the variable from within the thread rather than passing in the variable. Or pass in the $ID for the variable and difference the variable from the thread (which essentially does the same thing as a variable lookup but allows a different variable name to be used). 

If accessing shared resources from within a thread, take care and use thread save logic, such as lock/unlock. 

The following is an example of creating a thread.

```
myRun = op(input) {"myRun:".echo();$sys().echo(@local); @input.c = @input.a+@input.b; "\n".echo(); @local;};
myDone = op(input,result) {"myDone:".echo();$sys().echo(@local); "\n".echo();};
t = $thread();
@t.start(@myRun,{a:1,b:2},@myDone);
```

Output for above
```
myRun:{"input":{"a":1,"b":2}}
myDone:{"input":{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3},"result":{"input":{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3}}}
```

The input parameter is passed to both the run op and done op. The done op also receives any output from the run op.


#### stop()
Stops the thread.

#### started()
Indicates the running state of the thread.

#### suspend()
Suspends the thread. If the thread is processing a queue and the queue is empty, put the thread in suspend mode. Than after pushing data onto the queue, call resume to have the thread resume processing.

#### resume()
See suspend.

#### suspended()
Indicates whether the thread is in a suspended state.

## Custom Class Types
Create custom types using the class routine. The underlying structure is a $LIST where variables are stored, and the class can inherit other classes, including system types/classes (each system type is initiated as a class instance).

The following example defines a class with a single method. The method setdiv2 updates data to the parameter divided by 2.
```
> myClass = class {data = 0; setdiv2 = op(p){data = @p/2;}; get = op(){@data;};};

> test = myClass();

> @test.setdiv2(5);

> @test.get();
2

> @test
{"data":2}
```

* (<0)|(0)|(>0) ? statement for -1 : statement for 0 : statement for 1;

Example:

> 0?hi:by
by

> -55?hi:by:there
hi

> ("a"<=>"b")?a:e:b
a
```

### Function Operators
#### op
Creating an $OP. See $OP.

#### class
Creates a class that can be used to generate an instance of the class. The class definition is shared between all instances using the class. If information in the class is altered, a copy is made and the modified variable is added to the instance. The instance stores the class reference and any variables local to the instance. Classes can inherit 1 or more other classes. 

```
myC = class {myV = 0; myF = op(a){myV=@a};};
myC2 = class (myC) {myV2 = 0; myF2 = op(a){myV2=@a};};
myIns = obj @myC2;
@myIns;
{}

@myIns.myF(4);
@myIns.myV;
4

@myIns.myV2;
0

@myIns;
{"myV":4}
```

#### obj
Creating an instance of a class. See class.

#### token
Used to define lexical rules. Currently only used to define special character handling like space and tab, where the default handling is to skip these characters so they do not need to be specified in the grammar. 

#### rule
See $RULE

#### const
Compile time option. Used primarily for $RULE. See $RULE.

#### literal
Any sequence starting with an ascii letter, and including numbers and '_'. 

#### literal ([params])
Assumes literal is a variable reference for $OP or $CODE, and runs the routine passing in parameters specified. See $OP and $CODE.

### Command Operators
#### $INCLUDE
Loads referenced file during compile time. Also useful for testing a library or class file by using $INCLUDE to reload the file.

```
$INCLUDE "lib/grapa/grapa.grc";
```

#### exit
Causes the command line shell / console to exit. Primarily used for a script that is initiated from the command line.

If used in the console, the exit will not happen until another command is issued from the shell. This is because everything is handled async.

To exit while in the console, enter a '.' character.

### Lexical Operators
There are several predefined lexical operators, most of which define how $ID, $INT, $FLOAT, $STR, etc, are processed and generate the corresponding tokens. There are also a few other lexical operators that will trigger special handling of the input stream. The following are two examples. Currently there is no way to define/change the lexical operators - this will come in some future version of grapa.

#### `$&`
  * Wrap the XML data in $& on either side to have grapa parse the input as XML. These characters are special lexical triggers that modify the parsing engine token generation. The first instance turns the mode on and the second turns the mode off. Or use the encode("XML") function, which does the same thing.
#### `$[`
  * Wrap input in these characters to have the entire code block parsed in a single instance. Otherwise a '\n' or '\r' will be used to trigger parsing/execution and an error would result if the line is not valid on it's own. Alternatively, put the code in a file, load the file contents, and execute the contents of the string.

### Conditions

#### if

Syntax options:
* if (bool) statement;
* if (bool) statement; else statement;
* if (bool) statement; elseif statement; else statement;

Example:
```
> if (1==0) "1==0\n".echo();  else "none\n".echo();
none

> if (1==0) "1==0\n".echo(); elseif (2==2) "2==2\n".echo(); else "none\n".echo();
2==2
```

#### switch

Syntax options:
* swtich (item) {case item1: statement; item2 statement; etc...;};
* swtich (item) {case item1: statement; item2 statement; etc...; default: statement;};

The following is a way to use a switch in place of if/ifelse/else sequence. The switch will compare until if arrives at a true.

```
> switch(true){case (1==0):"1==0\n".echo(); case (2==2): "2==2\n".echo(); default: "none\n".echo();};
2==2
```


### Loops

#### while
Sytax:
* while(bool) statement;

Example:
```
> i = 0; while (@i<5) {i+=1; (@i.str()+":").echo();}; "\n".echo();
1:2:3:4:5:
```


#### map
Sytax:
* list|array . map ( op );
* list|array . map ( op , param1, param2, etc);

Where op is:
* op (listvalue, param1, param2, etc) ( script )
* op (listvalue, param1, param2, et) { statement;}

Note: each item of the array will process in a separate thread. This is an easy way to add multi-threading to the processing, but beware and batch workoads in the array to keep the size of the array to the number of threads you want.

Take caution on accessing shared resources from within a map or reduce or $thread or $net operation...esure thread safe by using lock/unlock (any variable can be used for lock/unlock).

Example:
```
> [1,2,3].map(op(n){@n*2});
[2,4,6]

> [1,2,3].map(op(n,p){@n*2+@p},5);
[7,9,11]
```

#### reduce
Sytax:
* list|array . filter ( op );
* list|array . reduce ( op , startvalue);
* list|array . reduce ( op , startvalue, param1, param2, etc);

Where op is:
* op (startvalue, listvalue, param1, param2, etc) ( script )

Reduce process sequentially, as processing is intended to augment the startvalue. If the startvalue is not provided, the first item in the list is used as the startvalue.

Take caution on accessing shared resources from within a map or reduce or $thread or $net operation...esure thread safe by using lock/unlock (any variable can be used for lock/unlock).

Example:
```

#### filter
Sytax:
* list|array . filter ( op );
* list|array . filter ( op , param1, param2, etc);

Where op is:
* op (listvalue, param1, param2, etc) ( script )
* op (listvalue, param1, param2, et) { statement;}

Note: each item of the array will process in a separate thread. This is an easy way to add multi-threading to the processing, but beware and batch workoads in the array to keep the size of the array to the number of threads you want.

Example:
```
> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].filter(op(n){@n%2!=0});
[1,3,5,7,9]

> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].filter(op(n,p){@n%@p!=0},3);
[1,2,4,5,7,8]
```

## Language Syntax
### Default Language Rules
To view a text version of the rules loaded into grapa on startup, run the following at the prompt:

```
> $sys().getenv($STATICLIB)."grapa.grc".str()
```

The system will first check for a match on the "start" rule. Which is a global variable...if that global variable is of type $RULE, than it will be come the first rule for scripts. This is an easy way to provide an override on command processing. If "start" rule does not provide a match, than the system will evaluage using the "$start" rule. 

The default rules may be subject to change, and so are not listed here. Use the above command to retrieve/view.  To write the result to a file, use the following:

```
> $file().setrow("grapa.grc",$sys().getenv($STATICLIB)."grapa.grc".str())
```

This will place the file in the current working directory. If you want to place in a different directly, refer to the $file class for commands to do that.

If you modify the file, you can try it out by placing it in "lib/grapa/" under the same directory that the above command would have written the file to, and then restart grapa. If grapa finds this file with this name in that location, it will use that file instead of the default. 

If you are familiar with YACC or BNF, following the grammar logic should be rather straight forward. Each rule is evaluated until a successful match, and all matches produce an execution play where the code associated with each rule match is included in the execution plan. To optimize grammar resolution, rules carefully constructed to avoid re-evaluating rules more than necessary by placing the most complex rules first and following with common rule patters. It is also important to avoid infinite recursive situations - mostly this is avoided by not referencing the same rule as the first token to evaluate. 

There are a few standard tokens that are defined - mostly the tokens provide special handling for either the lexical engine or the rules engine. One example is the space character, which when found a bit is set in the token skip the value for rules evaluation. This can be changed - but then would require including including the space token in the rules. 

### Precedence

| Operator| Description | Associativity
|--|--|--|
| `a` `@a` | token, contents of token | right->left |
| `a()` | function call | right->left |
| `a.b` `a[b]` | lookup | right->left |
| `+a` `-a` `!a` `~a` | Unary plus, minus, not, bitwise not | right->left |

### Operator

Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
f=op(){3%2};</br>f(); | 1
f=@<[op,@<mod,{3,2}>],{}>;</br>f(); | 1
f=op(a,b){@a%@b};</br>f(); | @<[op,@<mod,{@<var,{a}>,@<var,{b}>}>],{a,b}>
f(842,5); | 2
f=op(a,b,c){d=@a%@b;@d*@c;};</br>f(); | @<[op,@[@<assign,{d,@<mod,{@<var,{a}>,@<var,{b}>}>}>,@<mul,{@<var,{d}>,@<var,{c}>}>]],{a,b,c}>
f(842,5,9); | 18

You can also define an operation by providing a script and a rule. If a rule is not specified, the "start" and "$start" rules are used (which is the default entry point for the grapa language).

Commands | Results
------------ | -------------
op()("4*2"); | @<[op,8],{}>
op()("4*2",@$start); | @<[op,8],{}>
op()("4*2", rule $INT '*' $INT {op(a:$1,b:$3){@a**@b}}); | @<[op,@<[op,@<pow,{@<var,{a}>,@<var,{b}>}>],{"a":4,"b":2}>],{}>
f = op()("4*2", rule $INT '*' $INT {op(a:$1,b:$3){@a**@b}});</br>f(); | 16

Note in the last example the rule to use was defined and passed in as a parameter to the planer, the operation result assigned to a variable, and then the variable executed as a function.

If the rules have already been defined, the following options to generate the execution plan - for either storing as a function or for debugging the rules.

Commands | Results | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
`r = rule $INT '*' $INT {op(a:$1,b:$3){@a**@b}};` |  | Rule for "int * int", with associated code that applies the power operator
f = op()("4*2",@r);</br>f(); | 16 | Applying the rule to create a function, and running the function
f = @r.plan("4*2");</br>f(); | 16 | Another way to apply the rule
(@r.plan("4*2"))(); | 16 | Apply the rule and run the function in the same command

### Function Chaining
Any object that returns an object can be chained.

For example "4.4".float(300,4).pi() will convert the string 4.4 to a float with 300 bit precision and will return pi() to the power of the input, at the precision specified in the input. So, a 400 bit precision of pi to the power of 4.4. 

If an existing function/command doesn't support chaining, an OP can be inserted in the chain to make it work using the $$ variable for the result of the prior operation. For example, the following will get the length of a list, generate that many bits, and output the result in binary form. The 3 examples all accomplish the same result.
```
> {1,2,3,5}.{(@$$).len()}.genbits().bin()
1111

> {1,2,3,5}.{(op(a){@a.len()})(@$$)}.genbits().bin()
1111

> f = op(a){@a.len()};
> {1,2,3,5}.f(@$$).genbits().bin();
1111
```

The following returns the length of each word in a string:
```
> "this is a test".split(" ").reduce(op(a,b){@a+=@b.len();},[])
[4,2,1,4]
```

## Grammer Updating

The standard grammer loaded by default includes suport for 2 user defined rules that assist in easily modifying the grammer.

custom_start - The engine will evaulate the $start rule before evaluating the predefined $start rule. Setting a variable "start" with a rule will cause the engine to call the user defined rule first. If this variable is set locally within a function, it will only apply to scripts parsed from within the scope of that function.

custom_function - The engine will evaluate the variable "function" if it is a $RULE as a part of the $function rule. To verify, check the $function variable. Used in contexts where a value is returned.

custom_command - Same as above. Used in contexts where a value is not returned.

Alternative, redefine any of the predefined rules for the default grammer. Take caution on changing the global variable, unless the change is inteded for the entire session. Restart the app to revert back. 

If any of the above is set as a local variable within some scope, such as a class instance or a function, the modification will only apply for exectution within that scope. You can, for example, have muliple threads with unique modifications that apply separately. This is bascially the result of having the rules implemented as variables.
