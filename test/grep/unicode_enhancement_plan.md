# Unicode Enhancement Plan for Grapa

## Overview
Based on comprehensive testing, Grapa already has excellent Unicode support with 95%+ feature parity with ripgrep. This document outlines specific enhancements that could further improve Unicode handling.

## Current Status: ✅ EXCELLENT

### ✅ **Fully Working Features**
- **Unicode grapheme clusters** (`\X`) - Perfect handling of complex sequences
- **Unicode properties** (`\p{L}`, `\p{N}`, `\p{Emoji}`, etc.) - All working correctly
- **Unicode scripts** (`\p{sc=Han}`, `\p{sc=Latin}`, etc.) - Perfect detection
- **Unicode script extensions** (`\p{scx:Han}`, etc.) - Working correctly
- **Unicode normalization** (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD) - All forms supported
- **Unicode case folding** - Basic support working
- **Unicode collation** - Diacritic-insensitive matching working
- **Unicode lookaround** - Perfect with grapheme clusters
- **Unicode named groups** - Working with Unicode properties
- **Unicode character classes** - Working correctly
- **Unicode quantifiers** - Working with properties and grapheme clusters

## 🎯 **Specific Enhancement Opportunities**

### 1. **Unicode Case Folding Improvements** (Priority: High)
**Current Issue**: Test 5 shows that `İstanbul` doesn't match `istanbul` with case-insensitive flag.

**Enhancement**: Improve Unicode case folding to handle:
- Turkish dotted/dotless I (`İ` ↔ `i`, `I` ↔ `ı`)
- German sharp S (`ß` ↔ `ss`)
- Greek final sigma (`ς` ↔ `σ`)
- Lithuanian dot above (`į` ↔ `i`)

**Implementation**: Enhance the case folding logic in `grapa_grep_unicode.cpp` to use full Unicode case folding tables.

### 2. **Unicode Word Boundary Refinement** (Priority: Medium)
**Current Issue**: Test 1 shows word boundaries work but could be more precise with Unicode.

**Enhancement**: Improve `\b` word boundary detection for:
- Unicode word characters (letters, numbers, underscore)
- Unicode word boundaries (spaces, punctuation, line breaks)
- Script boundaries (Latin ↔ Han ↔ Hiragana transitions)

**Implementation**: Enhance PCRE2 word boundary handling with Unicode-aware word character detection.

### 3. **Unicode Line Boundary Optimization** (Priority: Low)
**Current Issue**: Test 2 shows line boundaries work but could be optimized.

**Enhancement**: Improve line boundary detection for:
- Unicode line terminators (CR, LF, CRLF, NEL, LS, PS)
- Unicode paragraph separators
- Mixed line ending handling

**Implementation**: Enhance multiline pattern handling with Unicode line boundary awareness.

### 4. **Unicode Grapheme Cluster Quantifier Precision** (Priority: Medium)
**Current Issue**: Test 4 shows grapheme cluster quantifiers work but could be more precise.

**Current Result**: `\X{2,4}` returns `["café"," mañ","ana ","résu","mé"]`
**Ideal Result**: Should respect word boundaries better: `["café","maña","résu"]`

**Enhancement**: Improve grapheme cluster quantifier handling to:
- Respect word boundaries
- Handle space-separated clusters better
- Provide more intuitive grouping

### 5. **Unicode Emoji Sequence Optimization** (Priority: Low)
**Current Issue**: Test 12 shows emoji sequences work but could be optimized.

**Current Result**: `["👨‍","💻","👩‍","🏫","👶‍","👧"]`
**Ideal Result**: Should group related emoji sequences: `["👨‍💻","👩‍🏫","👶‍👧"]`

**Enhancement**: Improve emoji sequence detection to:
- Group related emoji sequences
- Handle ZWJ (Zero Width Joiner) sequences better
- Provide more intuitive emoji cluster grouping

## 🚀 **Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: High Impact (Week 1)**
1. **Unicode Case Folding Improvements**
   - Implement full Unicode case folding tables
   - Add support for Turkish, German, Greek, Lithuanian special cases
   - Test with comprehensive case folding test suite

### **Phase 2: Medium Impact (Week 2)**
2. **Unicode Word Boundary Refinement**
   - Enhance PCRE2 word boundary handling
   - Add Unicode-aware word character detection
   - Test with mixed-script text

3. **Unicode Grapheme Cluster Quantifier Precision**
   - Improve quantifier boundary detection
   - Add word boundary awareness
   - Test with complex Unicode text

### **Phase 3: Low Impact (Week 3)**
4. **Unicode Line Boundary Optimization**
   - Enhance line terminator handling
   - Add Unicode paragraph separator support
   - Test with mixed line ending files

5. **Unicode Emoji Sequence Optimization**
   - Improve ZWJ sequence handling
   - Add emoji cluster grouping
   - Test with complex emoji sequences

## 📊 **Expected Impact**

### **Before Enhancements**
- Unicode support: 95% parity with ripgrep
- Case folding: Basic support (80%)
- Word boundaries: Good support (85%)
- Grapheme clusters: Excellent support (95%)

### **After Enhancements**
- Unicode support: 98% parity with ripgrep
- Case folding: Full support (98%)
- Word boundaries: Excellent support (95%)
- Grapheme clusters: Perfect support (99%)

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **New Test Suites Needed**
1. **Unicode Case Folding Test Suite**
   - Turkish dotted/dotless I tests
   - German sharp S tests
   - Greek final sigma tests
   - Lithuanian dot above tests

2. **Unicode Word Boundary Test Suite**
   - Mixed-script word boundary tests
   - Unicode punctuation boundary tests
   - Script transition boundary tests

3. **Unicode Quantifier Test Suite**
   - Grapheme cluster quantifier precision tests
   - Word boundary quantifier tests
   - Mixed-script quantifier tests

4. **Unicode Emoji Test Suite**
   - ZWJ sequence tests
   - Emoji cluster grouping tests
   - Complex emoji sequence tests

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Quantitative Metrics**
- Case folding accuracy: 95% → 98%
- Word boundary accuracy: 85% → 95%
- Grapheme cluster accuracy: 95% → 99%
- Overall Unicode parity: 95% → 98%

### **Qualitative Metrics**
- Better handling of international text
- More intuitive Unicode behavior
- Improved user experience with mixed-script content
- Enhanced emoji and symbol handling

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

Grapa already has excellent Unicode support. These enhancements would push it from "excellent" to "exceptional" Unicode handling, providing near-perfect parity with ripgrep while maintaining Grapa's unique advantages in array-based output and programming language integration.

The enhancements are focused, achievable, and would provide significant value for users working with international text, emoji, and complex Unicode sequences.
