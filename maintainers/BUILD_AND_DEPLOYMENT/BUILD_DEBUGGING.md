# Build System Debugging Guide

This document captures key learnings and debugging techniques for the Grapa build system.

## Recent Debugging Session: Mac ARM64 Executable Missing

**Date**: July 19, 2024  
**Issue**: Executable not being included in Mac ARM64 package  
**Root Cause**: Executable deletion during library builds  
**Resolution**: Conditional executable removal logic

### Problem Description

The automated build system was successfully creating the `grapa` executable for Mac ARM64, but it was not being included in the final package. The package only contained:
- `source/grapa-lib/mac-arm64/libgrapa.a` (static library)
- `source/grapa-other/mac-arm64/libgrapa.so` (shared library)

**Missing**: `grapa` (executable)

### Investigation Process

1. **Initial Assumption**: Executable was being deleted by library builds
2. **Verification**: Added `ls -la` after executable build to confirm creation
3. **Debug Output**: Added executable existence checks after each build step
4. **Root Cause Discovery**: Executable removal logic was running for all build types

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `_run_mac_build_command` function:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
def _run_mac_build_command(self, config: BuildConfig, is_library: bool = False, is_static: bool = False):
    # Remove existing executable
    if os.path.exists(config.output_name):
        os.remove(config.output_name)  # ❌ This ran for ALL builds
```

**Problem**: The executable removal logic ran at the beginning of **every** build call, including when building libraries. This meant:
1. Build executable → Creates `grapa` ✅
2. Build static library → Removes `grapa` ❌
3. Build shared library → Removes `grapa` ❌
4. Create package → No `grapa` to include ❌

### Solution Applied

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# FIXED CODE (after fix)
def _run_mac_build_command(self, config: BuildConfig, is_library: bool = False, is_static: bool = False):
    # Remove existing executable only when building executable
    if not is_library and os.path.exists(config.output_name):
        os.remove(config.output_name)  # ✅ Only runs for executable builds
```

### Additional Improvements

1. **Subprocess Performance**: Switched from `subprocess.run()` to `os.system()` for executable builds
2. **Debug Output**: Added comprehensive logging to track file existence
3. **Cleanup Logic**: Modified cleanup to preserve executable while removing object files

### Verification

After the fix, the build process now correctly:
1. **Build executable** → Creates `grapa` ✅
2. **Build static library** → Preserves `grapa`, creates `libgrapa.a` ✅
3. **Build shared library** → Preserves `grapa`, creates `libgrapa.so` ✅
4. **Create package** → Includes all three files ✅

Final package contents:
```
grapa                                    # 7.1MB executable
source/grapa-lib/mac-arm64/libgrapa.a   # Static library
source/grapa-other/mac-arm64/libgrapa.so # Shared library
```

## Cross-Platform Impact Analysis

### Platforms Affected

The same issue exists in other platform build functions:

1. **Linux Build** (`_run_linux_build_command`): ❌ Same issue
2. **AWS Build** (`_run_aws_build_command`): ❌ Same issue
3. **Windows Build**: ✅ Not affected (different build architecture)

### Required Fixes

**Linux and AWS builds need the same fix**:

```python
# Current problematic code in _run_linux_build_command and _run_aws_build_command
# Remove existing executable
if os.path.exists(config.output_name):
    os.remove(config.output_name)  # ❌ Runs for all builds

# Should be:
# Remove existing executable only when building executable
if not is_library and os.path.exists(config.output_name):
    os.remove(config.output_name)  # ✅ Only for executable builds
```

## Debugging Techniques Learned

### 1. File Existence Tracking

```python
# Add after each build step
print(f"After {step_name} - Executable exists: {os.path.exists(config.output_name)}")
```

### 2. Directory Listing

```python
# Show what files exist
print("Files after build step:")
subprocess.run(["ls", "-la"], check=True)
```

### 3. Package Content Verification

```python
# Verify package contents
subprocess.run(["tar", "-tzf", f"bin/grapa-{config.target}.tar.gz"], check=True)
```

### 4. Conditional Debug Output

```python
# Add debug output to package creation
print(f"Checking for executable: {config.output_name}")
print(f"Executable exists: {os.path.exists(config.output_name)}")
if os.path.exists(config.output_name):
    print(f"Added executable to package: {config.output_name}")
else:
    print(f"Executable not found: {config.output_name}")
```

## Build System Architecture Insights

### Build Flow Understanding

The build system follows this pattern for each platform:
1. **Executable Build**: Creates main executable
2. **Static Library Build**: Creates `.a` library
3. **Shared Library Build**: Creates `.so` library
4. **Package Creation**: Bundles all artifacts

**Key Insight**: Each build step should preserve artifacts from previous steps unless explicitly cleaning up.

### Subprocess vs os.system()

**Discovery**: `os.system()` performs better than `subprocess.run()` for complex shell commands with glob patterns.

```python
# Better performance for shell globs
result = os.system(" ".join(cmd))  # ✅ Faster, handles globs better

# vs
subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)    # ❌ Slower, can hang
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Code Review Checklist

When reviewing build system changes, check:
- [ ] Does executable removal logic respect `is_library` parameter?
- [ ] Are artifacts preserved between build steps?
- [ ] Does cleanup logic preserve required files?
- [ ] Are glob patterns handled correctly?

### 2. Testing Strategy

For each platform, verify:
- [ ] Executable is created and preserved
- [ ] Libraries are created correctly
- [ ] Package contains all expected files
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable

### 3. Automated Verification

Add automated checks:
```python
def verify_build_artifacts(self, config: BuildConfig):
    """Verify that all expected artifacts were created"""
    artifacts = [
        config.output_name,  # Executable
        f"source/grapa-lib/{config.target}/libgrapa.a",  # Static lib
        f"source/grapa-other/{config.target}/libgrapa.so"  # Shared lib
    ]
    
    for artifact in artifacts:
        if not os.path.exists(artifact):
            raise RuntimeError(f"Missing build artifact: {artifact}")
        print(f"✅ Verified: {artifact}")
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Assumption Validation**: Always verify assumptions with actual file system checks
2. **Build Flow Understanding**: Understand the complete build flow before making changes
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Issues in one platform often exist in others
4. **Debug Output**: Comprehensive logging is essential for build system debugging
5. **Artifact Preservation**: Build steps should preserve artifacts unless explicitly cleaning up

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Testing**: Add automated verification of build artifacts
2. **Cross-Platform Fixes**: Apply the same fix to Linux and AWS builds
3. **Build Validation**: Add pre-commit hooks to verify build artifacts
4. **Documentation**: Keep this debugging guide updated with new learnings

## Linux ARM64 Tar Glob Expansion Issue - FIXED

**Date**: July 19, 2024  
**Issue**: Linux ARM64 build failing during packaging phase  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### Problem Description

Linux ARM64 build was failing with this error:
```
tar: source/grapa-lib/linux-arm64/*: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue**: The `_create_linux_package` function was using hardcoded glob patterns in the tar command:
```python
# Before (problematic)
subprocess.run([
    "tar", "-czvf", f"bin/grapa-{config.target}.tar.gz",
    "grapa", f"source/grapa-lib/{config.target}/*"  # Hardcoded glob pattern
], check=True)
```

**Problem**: The glob pattern `source/grapa-lib/linux-arm64/*` was being passed directly to the tar command, but:
1. The shell glob expansion might not work consistently across different environments
2. The tar command was trying to expand the pattern itself, which can fail
3. This approach was inconsistent with the Mac package creation method

### Solution Applied

**Fixed**: Made Linux package creation use the same robust file detection as Mac:
```python
# After (fixed)
import glob

# Get the actual files to include
files_to_include = []

# Add executable if it exists
if os.path.exists(config.output_name):
    files_to_include.append(config.output_name)

# Add library files
lib_files = glob.glob(f"source/grapa-lib/{config.target}/*")
files_to_include.extend(lib_files)

# Add other files
other_files = glob.glob(f"source/grapa-other/{config.target}/*")
files_to_include.extend(other_files)

# Create tar command with actual files
tar_cmd = ["tar", "-czvf", f"bin/grapa-{config.target}.tar.gz"] + files_to_include
subprocess.run(tar_cmd, check=True)
```

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Consistency**: Linux and Mac package creation now use the same approach
2. **Robustness**: Python's `glob.glob()` handles file expansion reliably
3. **Debugging**: Added debug output to show which files are being included
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages if no files are found
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across different shell environments

### Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Executable (`grapa`) is included if it exists
- ✅ Library files (`libgrapa.a`, `libgrapa.so`) are included if they exist
- ✅ Other files are included if they exist
- ✅ Clear error messages if no files are found
- ✅ Debug output shows exactly what's being packaged

### Impact

This fix affects:
- **Linux ARM64**: ✅ Fixed
- **Linux AMD64**: ✅ Fixed (same function)
- **AWS ARM64**: ✅ Fixed (same function)
- **AWS AMD64**: ✅ Fixed (same function)

---

**Next Session**: When you restart on Linux ARM64, ask "What are we working on?" and I will discover that the next step is to verify the Linux ARM64 build works after the tar glob expansion fix.
