## üîç **INVESTIGATION ITEMS (No Timeline)**

### 5. **$KEY Field Datatype Investigation**
- **Description**: Investigate allowing any datatype for the $KEY field instead of hardcoded string type
- **Current Workaround**: Use .raw().int() or .raw().float() for numeric keys
- **Questions**:
  - Is this a design limitation or implementation constraint?
  - What would be the performance impact of supporting other types?
  - Are there use cases that would benefit from numeric keys?
- **Status**: Pending investigation
- **Priority**: Low

### 6. **String Splitting Functionality Investigation**
- **Description**: Investigate commented-out string splitting code in division operator
- **Source**: `GrapaLibraryRuleDivEvent::Run` (commented code)
- **Questions**:
  - Was this intentionally disabled or incomplete?
  - Should string splitting be a separate operator or method?
  - What would be the expected behavior?
- **Status**: Pending investigation
- **Priority**: Low

### 7. **Array/List Comparison Behavior Confirmation**
- **Description**: Confirm design decision on array/list comparison behavior
- **Current Behavior**: `[1,2,3] == [1,2,4]` returns TRUE (object ID comparison)
- **Expected Behavior**: Should return FALSE (content comparison)
- **Questions**:
  - Is object ID comparison intentional for performance?
  - Should we have both object ID and content comparison operators?
  - What do users expect from array comparison?
- **Status**: Pending design decision
- **Priority**: Low
