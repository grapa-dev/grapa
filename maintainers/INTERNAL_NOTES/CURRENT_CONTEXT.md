# Current Context - Grapa Documentation and Development

## Recent Accomplishments (2024-06)

- ✅ All documentation, migration guides, and code samples are up to date, accurate, and compliant with canonical Grapa syntax (including comment rules and ambiguous reference audit).
- ✅ Production Readiness Assessment updated to reflect documentation overhaul and improved onboarding; readiness now at 90%.
- ✅ All migration guides (Go, TypeScript, Rust, Python, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, Ruby) are clear, accurate, and free of ambiguous references.
- ✅ All TODOs and context are current as of this session.

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Investigate and fix the custom delimiter bug in Grapa grep.**
   - This is the highest priority technical blocker for production use.
   - The custom delimiter test currently fails; underlying implementation needs to be fixed.
   - Action: Investigate and resolve the custom delimiter handling in the Grapa grep implementation.

2. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Design and run performance tests, measure memory/CPU usage, and document results.

3. **Comprehensive Ripgrep Comparison Suite**
   - Maintain and expand side-by-side output validation suite as Grapa evolves.

4. **Automated Regression Testing**
   - Integrate regression tests into CI/CD to prevent future regressions.

5. **Performance Comparison Suite (Future Task)**
   - Create a performance test suite for Grapa (pure operations, no IO) and Python for direct comparison.
   - Write a `.grc` file (or multiple) for Grapa (single-threaded and multi-threaded), and a `.py` file for Python, each running equivalent tests.
   - The suite should demonstrate Grapa's multiprocess performance improvements.

## Technical Debt
- No outstanding documentation or migration guide issues.
- All ambiguous references and syntax issues are resolved.

## How to Resume
- Pick up with item 1: Investigate and fix the custom delimiter bug in Grapa grep.
- All context, priorities, and recent changes are recorded here for seamless resumption.
