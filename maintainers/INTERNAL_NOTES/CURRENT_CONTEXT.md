# Current Context - Documentation & User Experience Focus

## Recent Progress (Latest Session)

### Documentation Link Fixes Completed
- Fixed broken test file paths in migration guides
- Removed references to internal maintainers directories from user-facing docs
- Corrected broken links in grep documentation
- Verified all internal and external links are working
- All migration guides (Python, JavaScript, Rust, TypeScript, Go, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift) are clean

### Unicode Implementation Status
- C++ backend case folding is working correctly (Turkish I, German sharp S, etc.)
- Grapa language binding for case folding is missing (identified but not implemented)
- New lookup table-based case folding implemented in C++
- All debug printfs properly wrapped and disabled
- Unicode case folding moved to backlog for future implementation

## Current State
- Documentation is clean and ready for users
- Grapa grep implementation is stable and complete
- All broken links fixed
- Migration guides are comprehensive and accurate

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### 1. User Experience & Documentation Polish
- Test documentation build to ensure all links work
- Review and update any remaining outdated examples
- Verify migration guides are complete and accurate

### 2. Publish New Documentation
- Build and deploy updated documentation
- Verify all pages render correctly
- Test search functionality

### 3. Full Documentation Audit
- Review all documentation for redundancy
- Identify what can be merged or purged
- Consolidate overlapping content
- Remove outdated or unnecessary docs

### 4. Backlog Items (Future)
- Implement missing Unicode case folding language binding
- Add `.match()` method for strings
- Fix table `.get()` method to return proper types
- Add more comprehensive Unicode tests
- Improve error messages and debugging capabilities

## Technical Debt
- Unicode case folding language binding missing
- Table `.get()` returns raw bytes instead of proper types
- No `.match()` method for strings/regex
- Some debug code still in place (properly wrapped)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Documentation builds without errors
- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] Migration guides are accurate and complete
- [ ] Documentation is published and accessible
- [ ] Audit identifies consolidation opportunities
- [ ] User experience is polished and professional
