## 1. ETL / Data Engineering
Grapa excels at Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflows, offering parallelism, unlimited precision, and unified file/database APIs. Ideal for data cleaning, transformation, and large-scale processing.
- **See also:** [Python ETL Examples](PYTHON_ETL.md)

## 2. Compiler/BNF Learning
With executable BNF and mutable grammar, Grapa is perfect for teaching and experimenting with language design, parsing, and compiler construction.
- **See also:** [Python BNF/Compiler Examples](PYTHON_BNF.md)

## 3. High-Precision Math & Scientific Computing
Grapa’s $INT, $FLOAT, and $TIME types support unlimited precision, making it valuable for scientific, cryptographic, and financial applications.
- **See also:** [Python Math Examples](PYTHON_MATH.md)

## 4. Parallel/Concurrent Programming
Grapa’s $thread, $net, and map/reduce/filter features enable true parallelism, overcoming Python’s GIL and enabling high-performance data processing.
- **See also:** [Python Parallelism Examples](PYTHON_PARALLEL.md)

## 5. Web/Data Scraping & Automation
Grapa’s $net and parallelism features are powerful for web scraping, automation, and API integration.
