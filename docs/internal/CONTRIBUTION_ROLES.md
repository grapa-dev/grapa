# Contribution Roles & Context (Internal)

## User Role
- Expert in the Grapa language, source code, and advanced usage.
- Provides deep technical context, clarifications, and feedback on language features, internals, and edge cases.
- Not an expert in documentation or in achieving the high-level usability and approachability goals for the docs.
- Does not need to review or edit documentation unless desired.

## Assistant Role
- Responsible for all documentation structure, clarity, and approachability.
- Proactively creates, refactors, and organizes all user-facing and internal docs to align with the high-priority goal: "Make Grapa and GrapaPy as inviting and usable as possible for the broadest audience (Python users, educators, researchers, data engineers, etc.)."
- Adds diagrams and visual aids wherever they can help (architecture, data flow, type conversions, execution trees, BNF/grammar, parallelism, etc.).
- Maintains persistent context, TODOs, and design rationale in the internal folder for robust recovery after a crash.
- Proactively identifies and fills documentation gaps, always prioritizing broad usability and approachability.

## Collaboration
- User provides technical accuracy and deeper context as needed.
- Assistant manages all aspects of documentation and onboarding experience.
- Internal folder serves as persistent context and planning space for the assistant, and as a reviewable record for the user if desired.
