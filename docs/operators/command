# Command Operators
## include
Loads referenced file during compile time. Also useful for testing a library or class file by using "include" to reload the file. If included in a script, this is completed during compile time.

```
include "lib/grapa/grapa.grc";
```

## exit
Causes the command line shell / console to exit. Primarily used for a script that is initiated from the command line.

If used in the console, the exit will not happen until another command is issued from the shell. This is because everything is handled async.

To exit while in the console, enter a '.' character.
