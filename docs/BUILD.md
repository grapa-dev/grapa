# Installation
Suported platforms include Win64, MacOS, Ubuntu64, Debian32, AWS.

To instally copy the zip for the target platform, unzip, and copy to the exectutable to an apprpriate directory. If needed, update the system PATH. The binaries are located in the "bin" directory in this GitHub repository.

There will be an installer for each of the platforms...but for now, drag and drop of the binary works.
Linux: Place in "/usr/bin" (or somewhere accessible). 
Windows: Place in a location that is in the PATH, or update PATH to the location the application is copied to.
Mac: Place in "/usr/local/bin" - first time running the tool will take about 20 seconds as the OS scans the executable.
