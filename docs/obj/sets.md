# From $OBJ

## len()
Gets the length of the item.

```
"hi".len() -> 2
{1,2,3}.len() -> 3
```

## left(count)
Gets the left bytes of an item.

```
"testing".left(2) -> "te"
```

Use a negative number to truncate right.

```
"testing".left(-2) -> "testi"
```

## right(count)
Gets the right bytes of an item.

```
"testing".right(2) -> "ng"
```

Use a negative number to truncate left.

```
"testing".right(-2) -> "sting"
```

## mid(start,len)
Gets the middle bytes of an item.

```
"testing".mid(2,3) -> "sti"
```

## midtrim(items, offset, blocksize)

```
items = array of [label, offset, len, ltrim, rtrim, op]

"this is a test to see".midtrim([["a",2,1," "," "],["b",10,5," "," ",op(a){a.len();}]],1,13);
{"a":"s","b":3}
```

## rtrim([str])
Trims right.

```
"  testing  ".rtrim() -> "  testing"
"bbbtestingbbb".rtrim(b) -> "bbbtesting"
```

## ltrim([str])
Trims left.

```
"  testing  ".ltrim() -> "testing  "
"bbbtestingbbb".ltrim(b) -> "testingbbb"
```

## trim([str])
Trims both left and right.

```
"  testing  ".trim() -> "testing"
"bbbtestingbbb".trim(b) -> "testing"
```

## lpad(n,[str])
Pads left to bring the total size up to n characters. Defaults to pad with a space, but will use str for padding if provided. 

Will left truncate input if length of input is less than n.

```
"test".lpad(7,"X") -> "XXXtest"
```

## rpad(n,[str])
Pads left to bring the total size up to n characters. Defaults to pad with a space, but will use str for padding if provided. 

Will right truncate input if length of input is less than n.

```
"test".rpad(7,"X") -> "testXXX"
```

## lrot([n])
For $LIST, $ARRAY, $XML.

Moves n (defaul=1) items from the start of the list to the end of the list, 1 at a time.

```
["a","b","c","d","e"].lrot(2) -> ["c","d","e","a","b"]
```

## rrot([n])
For $LIST, $ARRAY, $XML.

Moves n (defaul=1) items from the end of the list to the start of the list, 1 at a time.

```
["a","b","c","d","e"].rrot(2) -> ["d","e","a","b","c"]
```

## reverse()
Reverses the older of a list.

```
{z:1,m:2,p:3,b:4}.reverse() -> {"b":4,"p":3,"m":2,"z":1}
"testing".reverse() -> "gnitset"
```

## replace(old,new)
Replaces iteems.

```
"testing".replace("t","g") -> "gesging"
```

## split(item [,param])
Splits into an array.

```
"one\ntwo\nthree".split("\n") -> ["one","two","three"]
"this is a test".split(" ") -> ["this","is","a","test"]
"this is a test split into parts".split(3) -> ["this is a t","est split i","nto parts"]
"this is a test split into parts".split(3," ") -> ["this is a test ","split into ","parts"]
```

## join(item)
Joins what has been split.

```
["this is a test ","split into ","parts"].join("") -> "this is a test split into part"
```

## upper()
Converts to upper case.

```
"hi".upper() -> "HI"
```

## lower()
Converts to lower.

```
"HI".lower() -> "hi"
```

## data = (stop).range(start,step)

```
(9).range(1,2);
[1,3,5,7]
```
