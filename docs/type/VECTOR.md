# $VECTOR

A $VECTOR is a multi-dimentional set of values. Most often either 1 or 2 dimentions. 

The syntax for a $VECTOR is the same as an $ARRAY, but uses a '#' before and after the array, and requires all values for each dimention to be specified (for a 2 dimentional vector, all rows much have the same number of columns).

See [$OBJ vector](../obj/vector.md) for additional functions.
