GrapaPy is a Python extension for the Grapa language, designed for advanced data processing, ETL, and language experimentation. GrapaPy brings robust, production-ready parallel ETL/data processing to Python. By leveraging Grapa’s C++ backend, GrapaPy enables true parallelism for high-throughput data workflows—bypassing Python’s GIL and making advanced data processing simple and fast.

Features:
- True parallel ETL/data processing from Python
- Hardened, production-ready parallelism
- High performance for large file processing, data transformation, analytics, and more
- Simple, functional API
