# WIP Context Snapshot (as of last save)

## Top Priority
- Revise the `description` and `long_description` in `setup.py` to be inviting, accurate, and up to date with the README and Python docs. This is in preparation for an official new release of Grapa and GrapaPy.

## Recent TODO Additions
- Keep `setup.py` metadata in sync with docs and PyPI.
- Explore and document options for distributing the Grapa CLI tool for easy installation and dependency management.
- Design and implement a universal, simplified build process for Grapa binaries (see BUILD.md), with separate commands for build, clean, and GrapaPy build.

## Crash Recovery Protocol
- All in-progress work is now saved frequently in `docs/internal/WIP/`.
- The persistent TODO is updated with WIP file references and current status.
- After any crash or restart (including switching machines), resume from the latest WIP file and TODO state.

## Current Focus
- Immediate next step: Draft improved `description` and `long_description` for `setup.py` (draw from README and Python docs).
- All other documentation, onboarding, and context management tasks remain in the TODO and will be resumed as needed.
